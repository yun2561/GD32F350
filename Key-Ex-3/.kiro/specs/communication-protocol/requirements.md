# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a new communication protocol to the GD32F3x0-based embedded system to enable reliable data exchange between the microcontroller and external devices. The protocol will provide structured message formatting, error detection, and flow control mechanisms to ensure robust communication in industrial or IoT applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want a standardized communication protocol, so that I can reliably exchange data between the microcontroller and external devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN the communication protocol SHALL be configured with default parameters
2. WHEN a message is transmitted THEN the protocol SHALL include header, payload, and checksum fields
3. WHEN a malformed message is received THEN the system SHALL reject the message and request retransmission
4. IF the communication medium is UART THEN the protocol SHALL support baud rates from 9600 to 115200 bps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want message framing and validation, so that I can ensure data integrity during transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is constructed THEN the system SHALL add start/end delimiters for frame synchronization
2. WHEN a message is received THEN the system SHALL validate the checksum before processing
3. WHEN checksum validation fails THEN the system SHALL discard the message and increment error counter
4. WHEN a complete valid message is received THEN the system SHALL trigger a callback function

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that communication remains stable under adverse conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transmission timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before reporting failure
2. WHEN buffer overflow is detected THEN the system SHALL clear buffers and reset communication state
3. WHEN communication errors exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL log error status and attempt recovery
4. IF recovery attempts fail THEN the system SHALL enter safe mode and signal error condition

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want a simple API interface, so that I can easily integrate the protocol into my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending data THEN the API SHALL provide functions for different message types (command, data, status)
2. WHEN receiving data THEN the API SHALL provide callback registration for different message handlers
3. WHEN querying status THEN the API SHALL return communication statistics and error counts
4. WHEN configuring protocol THEN the API SHALL allow runtime parameter changes (timeout, retries, buffer sizes)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintenance engineer, I want diagnostic capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot communication issues in the field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagnostic mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL log all transmitted and received messages
2. WHEN communication statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide message counts, error rates, and timing data
3. WHEN protocol state is queried THEN the system SHALL return current configuration and operational status
4. IF debug output is enabled THEN the system SHALL output protocol events via debug UART channel
